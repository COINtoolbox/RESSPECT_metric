## Are classification metrics good proxies for SN Ia cosmological constraining power?

This repository contains code allowing reproducibility of results presented in [Malz et al., 2022, in prep](). 

We list below a general description of each script/notebook. 

The input data necessary to reproduce these results are the unblided [PLAsTiCC](https://zenodo.org/record/2539456#.Yv9QxNJBxhE).

Output data is available at [zenodo]().

This project is part of RESSPECT, a joint effort by the [Cosmostatistics Initiative (COIN)](https://github.com/COINtoolbox/RESSPECT/blob/master/cosmostatistics-initiative.org) and the  [LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC)](https://lsstdesc.org/).
